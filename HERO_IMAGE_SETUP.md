# 🖼️ Hero Image Setup

Your beautiful rice planting image is now ready to be displayed as the main hero background!

## Where to Put Your Image

1. **Save your rice planting image** (the one with the smiling woman in the rice paddy)
2. **Name it:** `hero.jpg`
3. **Place it in:** `images/hero.jpg`

## Quick Setup Steps

1. Open your computer's file explorer
2. Go to: `C:\Users\Set Yusuf\Desktop\web_explain\images\`
3. Copy and paste your rice planting image into that folder
4. **Rename the image to:** `hero.jpg`

## Image Recommendations

For the best results, use an image that is:
- **Size:** At least 1920 x 1080 pixels (or larger)
- **Format:** JPG or PNG
- **File size:** Under 2MB for faster loading

## What I've Changed

✅ **Created the `images/` folder** for you  
✅ **Updated CSS** to show your image prominently behind the hero text  
✅ **Adjusted overlay opacity** so your beautiful image is visible  
✅ **Added parallax effect** with `background-attachment: fixed` for a modern look  

## Current Hero Section Style

The hero background now:
- Shows your rice planting image at 40% opacity
- Has a semi-transparent green overlay (70% and 60% opacity)
- Uses a fixed attachment for a parallax scrolling effect
- Is fully responsive for mobile devices

## Preview Your Changes

Once you add your `hero.jpg` image to the `images/` folder:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. You'll see your rice planting image beautifully displayed behind the title "ស្រូវ - Srov"
3. The image will be visible but won't overpower the text

## Tips

- If the image is too bright, the text might be hard to read
- If the image is too dark, you can reduce the overlay opacity in `styles.css` (line 146)
- Change `opacity: 0.4` in line 137 of `styles.css` to make the image more/less visible

## Need to Adjust?

**Make the image MORE visible:**
- In `styles.css` line 137: Change `opacity: 0.4` to `opacity: 0.6` or `0.7`
- In `styles.css` line 146: Change overlay opacity from `0.7` to `0.5`

**Make the image LESS visible (more text-readable):**
- In `styles.css` line 137: Change `opacity: 0.4` to `opacity: 0.2` or `0.3`
- In `styles.css` line 146: Keep or increase overlay opacity
